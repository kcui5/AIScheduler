AI Scheduler
=============================
Available at https://aischeduler.vercel.app/

I'm an AI Scheduler dedicated to helping you maintain your schedule and order your tasks in an optimized way. You can tell me your tasks and any context you'd like, such as priority, estimated time to complete, or anything else, and I'll decide on a schedule for you while taking into account the current time.

In the list of tasks I return to you, you can check off the items you complete, then suggest edits to make to the schedule, such as adding new tasks or removing tasks. Then click the 'Regenerate' button to get a new iteration of the schedule with all of this information taken into account.
